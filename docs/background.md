# Project Background

---

According to government data, we are currently experiencing some of the lowest unemployment rates in recent decades. This is very positive news for the American people, however, this arbitrary number might not tell a complete story. The nation is experiencing a phenomenon where millions of work-eligible men have simply left the workforce. (npr.org)[https://www.npr.org/2016/09/06/492849471/an-economic-mystery-why-are-men-leaving-the-workforce] By not actively searching for a job, they are no longer considered in the "unemployment" calculations. There is a shortage in many occupations that require formal education as we explain in the example of Nursing and Healthcare. This discussion is meant to expand on the disparity between skilled and unskilled jobs, education requirements and economics needs specific to the Tampa Bay Area.

## Historical Background

Put a discussion of any relevant historigraphy you think relates to the topic.You can discuss the historiography of specific times and places, but you can also discuss any theoretical literature you think is relevant.

You have freedom to roam from the narrow topic of your project to explore how different authors/schools of thought have impacted scholarly approaches over time. However, make sure that in the end you clearly relate how this discussion relates to the subject of your project and/or your choices in methods or interpreative models.

As you discuss different authors, you may site them using (author, page) style parenthetical notation. Make sure that a full citation in [Chicago](http://chicagomanualofstyle.org) is added to the 'docs/credits.md' page.

## Digital Background

You should also make sure to do research on any relevant digital work, whether scholarly articles or digital projects. Make sure to check Digital Humanities Quarterly, or [DHQ](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/), [Debates in the Digital Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/), [JStor](https://jstor.org), blogs and more to find relevant work.

You don't actually have to have a sepearte 'Digital Background' section. If it feels more natural to you, you may combine them into a single discussion. This is especially a good idea if you feel that with your topic you cannot talk about historiography without also talking about digital scholarship, and vice versa.
